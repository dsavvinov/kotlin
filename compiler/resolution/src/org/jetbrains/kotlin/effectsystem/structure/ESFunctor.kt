 * An abstraction of effect-generating nature of some compitation.

 * Its difference from [ContractDescriptor] is the same as the difference
 * between function' signature and its body. [ContractDescriptor] describes
 * some rules about how computation behaves, while [ESFunctor] describes, how exactly
 * those rules should be mapped into inner representation of EffectSystem,
 * i.e. which new effects this computation produces and how existing effects
 * are transformed.
